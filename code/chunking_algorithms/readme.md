Chunking Algorithms



This section has all of the chunking algorithms. We implemented/experimented with various different algorithms, which are presented here. We tried to clean/comment up the code so make it reader friendly :). To run, simply specify the directory to the different versions of the file (hard coded within each of the files) and just comment out the respective data type:
	
	1. Regular (Here expected two different versions)
	2. Morph Dataset (Data generated randomly)
	3. Archive (Dataset from Internet Archive)
