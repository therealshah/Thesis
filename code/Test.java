	Abstract: LocalMinima is a content dependant chunking method. It determines the boundaries for the document using the local minima. 
	All content dependant algorithms first hash the document using a sliding window of length w, which we will call the hash array. (12 for all these experiments). This step is true for all content dependant chunking algorithms.
	Next the cut points for the document are determined from the hash array, using a content dependant method, (Local Minima in this case).
	The original document is divided into chunks using the cut points as boundaries between the chunks. Different versions of the documents are
	using where the first chunks of the document are stored, whereas the second version is simply used to see of that portion of the document
	occurred.


	LocalMinima: This algorithm has a parameter, which we will call B or boundarySize associated with it. The algorithm declares a hash a cutpoint
	only if the hash is strictly less than the B hashes before it and B hashes after it. Continue if the current hash fails the conditions.
